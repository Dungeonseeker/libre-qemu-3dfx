# Wine D3D DLLs for qemu-3dfx

Cross-builds Wine's DirectDraw, Direct3D 8, Direct3D 9, and wined3d DLLs as
standalone 32-bit Windows binaries using MinGW-w64 + the wine9x-support
build system. Designed for use with
[qemu-3dfx](https://github.com/kjliew/qemu-3dfx) to provide hardware-accelerated
3dfx OpenGL passthrough for Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, and XP guests running inside QEMU.

## Built DLLs

Each Wine version produces four D3D DLLs:

| DLL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `wined3d.dll` | Wine's Direct3D translation layer + qemu-3dfx passthrough hooks + built-in D3DKMT emulation |
| `ddraw.dll` | DirectDraw + VidMem HAL stubs + ddrawwq.dll passthrough bridge |
| `d3d8.dll` | Direct3D 8 |
| `d3d9.dll` | Direct3D 9 |

All DLLs are universal binaries targeting Subsystem 4.0, compatible with
Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, and XP.

## Supported Wine Versions

| Version | Group | wined3d .c count | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| 1.8.7 | A | 26 | Same generation as wine9x-support (1.7.55) |
| 1.9.7 | A | 26 | Same structure as 1.8.7 |
| 2.0.5 | A | 26 | Same structure as 1.8.7 |
| 3.0.5 | B | 26 | Same as Group A |
| 4.12.1 | C | 27 | +adapter_gl.c, adapter_vk.c |
| 5.0.5 | C | 27 | +adapter_gl.c, adapter_vk.c |
| 6.0.4 | D | 30 | +context_gl.c, context_vk.c, shader_spirv.c |
| 7.0.2 | D | 30 | +context_gl.c, context_vk.c, shader_spirv.c |
| 8.0.2 | D | 30 | +context_gl.c, context_vk.c, shader_spirv.c |

All versions download the Wine source tarball, extract wined3d/ddraw/d3d8/d3d9
.c/.h files, and apply compatibility patches before building with the
wine9x-support Makefile and direct MinGW gcc compilation. The wine9x-support
directory provides the build infrastructure (Makefile, headers, compat layers) —
the actual DLL source comes from the Wine tarball.

## qemu-3dfx Passthrough Hooks

Custom code injected into the DLL builds, reverse-engineered from the
reference qemu-3dfx Wine 1.8.7 DLLs. Full documentation in
[`qemu-3dx-hooks.md`](qemu-3dx-hooks.md).

### wined3d.dll — 7 custom exports

| Export | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `wined3d_hal_3dfx` | HAL detection: checks exe name (ds9dw.exe) via GetModuleFileNameA, then probes display adapter for "QEMU Bochs" via EnumDisplayDevicesA |
| `wined3d_enum_hal_last` | Returns HAL enumeration complete flag (default TRUE) |
| `wined3d_passthru` | Set/get passthrough mode |
| `wined3d_override_cooplevel` | XORs flags into cooperative level for passthrough |
| `wined3d_override_rendertarget_view` | Sets bit 0x01 at offset 0x28 in resource access_flags |
| `wined3d_blit_fpslimit` | Blit frame rate limiter (GetTickCount + Sleep) |
| `wined3d_flip_fpslimit` | Flip frame rate limiter (GetTickCount + Sleep) |

### ddraw.dll — 20 HAL stubs + 6 COM helpers + ddrawwq.dll switcher

**HAL stubs** via `qemu3dfx_ddraw_hooks.c`: No-op stubs for VidMem
management, surface locking, DSound, and standard ddraw exports. Also
provides `AcquireDDThreadLock`/`ReleaseDDThreadLock` (forwarding to
wined3d mutex), `D3DParseUnknownCommand`, `DDInternalLock`/`DDInternalUnlock`,
and `CompleteCreateSysmemSurface`. The passthrough wrapper handles actual
video memory.

**ddrawwq.dll switcher** via `qemu3dfx_ddraw_passthrough.c`: At DllMain,
loads `ddrawwq.dll` (the system's original ddraw renamed by ddthru) and
forwards DirectDraw calls when qemu-3dfx HAL is active.

## Architecture

```
Guest Application
    |
    v
ddraw.dll ──── passthrough bridge (qemu3dfx_ddraw_passthrough.c)
    |           ├── DllMain → detect qemu-3dfx, load ddrawwq.dll, enable passthrough
    |           ├── DirectDrawCreate → forwards to ddrawwq.dll
    |           ├── SetCooperativeLevel → override coop level
    |           ├── Blit/Flip → FPS limiters
    |           └── RTV setup → mark for passthrough
    |
    |        ──── VidMem HAL stubs (qemu3dfx_ddraw_hooks.c)
    |           DDHAL32_VidMemAlloc, VidMemFree, etc.
    |
    v
wined3d.dll ─── HAL detection (exe name + "QEMU Bochs" adapter), manages passthrough state
    v
opengl32.dll (qemu-3dfx wrapper) → mesapt → Host GPU
```

## Build

### Docker (recommended)

Prerequisites: `docker` and `git`.

```bash
# Clone repository (completely self-contained, no submodules required)
git clone https://github.com/startergo/wined3d-windows.git
cd wined3d-windows

# Build Wine 6.0.4 universal DLLs (release / silent)
bash build-docker.sh --only 6.0.4

# Or build with debug logging enabled
bash build-docker.sh --only 6.0.4 --debug

# Build all supported versions
bash build-docker.sh
```

Output DLLs are automatically extracted to `./output/<version>/`:
```
output/
  6.0.4/
    wined3d.dll  d3d9.dll  d3d8.dll  ddraw.dll  msvcrt.dll  build-timestamp
```

### Build Groups

| Group | Versions | WINE_BRANCH | WINE_EXT |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
| A | 1.8.7, 1.9.7, 2.0.5 | 1.8, 1.9, 2.0 | tar.bz2, tar.xz |
| B | 3.0.5 | 3.0 | tar.xz |
| C | 4.12.1, 5.0.5 | 4.12, 5.0 | tar.xz |
| D | 6.0.4, 7.0.2, 8.0.2 | 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 | tar.xz |

### Local Build (Linux with MinGW cross-compiler)

```bash
bash build-ci.sh
```

### Options

```
bash build-ci.sh --force                # rebuild all versions
bash build-ci.sh --versions 1.8.7 6.0.4 # build specific versions
```

Output goes to `./output/<version>/`:

```
output/
  1.8.7/
    wined3d.dll  d3d9.dll  d3d8.dll  ddraw.dll  build-timestamp
```
